# VBA Challenge
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a macro in excel using VBA to be able to analyze the performance of different stocks during a given year quickly.n. For this challenge I repurposed that code that I wrote during Module 2, and measured the performance to make the script run faster.
## Results
As a result of this analysis, I found that the stocks we were looking at overall performed better in 2017 vs 2018.  In 2017, all except "TERP" had a positive return on investment.
